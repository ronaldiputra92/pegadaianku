## Database Changes

The following columns will be removed from the `pawn_transactions` table:

- `officer_signature` (TEXT, nullable) 
- `signed_at` (TIMESTAMP, nullable)

## Impact Assessment

### What Still Works:
- ✅ Transaction creation and management
- ✅ Transaction viewing and editing
- ✅ Appraisal functionality
- ✅ Payment processing
- ✅ Receipt printing (with manual signature lines)
- ✅ All other transaction features

### What Was Removed:
- ❌ Digital signature capture
- ❌ Digital signature storage
- ❌ Digital signature display
- ❌ Signature validation
- ❌ Signature-related notifications

## Manual Steps Required

1. **Run the database migration**:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```
   
   Or run the manual script:
   ```bash
   php remove_signature_fields.php
   ```

2. **Clear view cache** (if needed):
   ```bash
   php artisan view:clear
   ```

3. **Clear application cache** (if needed):
   ```bash
   php artisan cache:clear
   ```

## Testing Checklist

After implementing these changes, test the following:

- [ ] View transaction details (http://127.0.0.1:8000/transactions/5)
- [ ] Create new transaction
- [ ] Edit existing transaction
- [ ] Print transaction receipt
- [ ] Process payments
- [ ] Appraise items
- [ ] Verify no signature-related errors appear

## Notes

- The receipt still includes signature lines for manual signing
- All transaction functionality remains intact
- No data loss occurs (only signature-related fields are removed)
- The system is now simpler and more streamlined
- Manual signatures can still be collected on printed receipts
